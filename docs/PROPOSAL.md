### Summary

Supervised learning task that detects pre-recorded audio samples (training) within other audio sections (testing). We will be constructing our own dataset of human-made sounds (not words, more like simple noices you might make to a pet):
* click noise
* kissy noise
* popping noise
* whistle noise
* etc

#### Objective 1

First task will be working on multi-template detection (need to identify which template occurred, if any) in Matlab code and ramping up on a Python library to perform the same task. Aligning with the goals of the class, we aim to solve practicl problems and develop code that we can run in more diverse environments.

#### Objective 2

Enhance the robustness of the template detection by introducing altered test datasets (added echo, reverb, distortion, etc).

### Objective 3

Run the detection algorithm live. See if templates can be detected on a per/person basis. Investigate what other attributes can be derived about a detection event (loud vs soft event, close vs distant, aggrevated vs relaxed).
